### Machine Learning-Based Bank Customer Churn Prediction, 2023
Application of different Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will leave the bank, based on different features.
- Crafted multiple machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, and Logistic Regression) for predicting customer churn in banking sector.
- Executed comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, focusing on customer demographics, financial behaviors, and product usage to uncover key indicators of churn.
- Employed 5-Fold Cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis for model evaluation, identifying Random Forest as the most effective model with superior accuracy.
- Deployed the final model on PythonAnywhere using Flask, with a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions, and exported the model using pickles for efficient deployment.
- Model is deployed at the following link: https://asciorilli.pythonanywhere.com/Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction
